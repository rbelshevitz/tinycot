# TinyCoT
TinyCoT is a lightweight TCP relay server for ATAK/CoT clients. It supports multiple teams, event replay, optional CoT XMl dumping, and persistent state using JSON with automatic rotation. It also supports uploading Data Packages. 

Everything will be here soon. TinyCot was created to run on hardware with limited resources. It's not a replacement for enterprise-grade TAK servers and doesn't attempt to compete with them. At the moment there's no TLS support for clients because... I don't need it. :)
